#### Content
The research of INRS science group has further advanced in the technical aspect of real-time femtophotography, paving the way for its new applications. Provided by the INRS, Julie Robert has written an article on Science Daily briefly familiarizing with this study. A group of researchers led by professor Jinyang Liang have created a new device called SCARF.  Built upon past advancements, such as T-CUP system, the device allows an observation of ultrafast unique phenomena, called by the professor by the name of “optical chaos” – mainly laser ablations and shock-wave interaction with living cells. This may further introduce new ways of developing pharmaceuticals and medical treatments. At the time of publishing the article, the discovery is patent-pending, as it may further result in a marketable innovation to storm the market of photonics. 

#### Reflection
Provided that one of the recent Nobel prizes in physics was awarded for generating an attosecond laser pulse one may clearly see that photonics has become an important part of current scientific development. The article further proves this point by showing a new achievement of a research group. The ongoing issue about the new discoveries in physics and proceeding technical advancements is that they are becoming harder and harder to comprehend by a person unfamiliar with the subject. In the article, many of the phrases, especially these quoted directly from the scientists, are a combination of many complex ideas, which require a lot of effort to properly decipher. As I am deeply interested in theoretical physics, seeing humanity surpass the femtosecond barrier – only three orders of magnitude lower than the limit, recently assumed by Ferenc Krausz, is simply astonishing. To further study the field of photonics one should definitely possess an interdisciplinary skill in physics and computer science. For such daring there lies ahead a great award.

#### Content
The researchers at TU Wien have described a new way of storing data – by encoding holographic messages in simple plastic. Evan Constable introduces an analogue data storage technology – holograms, as an alternative for common digital options, available on the market. A hologram is different from an ordinary image in many ways, it provides structural data preservation, and can be interacted with using terahertz rays. Upon combining the interfering waves, the proceeding superposition produces the desired image. The capabilities of the technology allow for storing basic bit sequences, such as a bitcoin address. Calculations have to be made prior to the printing process, as each point has to have a defined thickness. Fortunately, the code performing the calculations is freely available on GitHub and the plastic plate can be printed using an ordinary 3D printer. The researchers have succeeded in showing how to utilize this unusual range of electromagnetic radiation.

#### Reflection
The new methods of encoding data are being developed right now as I write this text. And yet another one is found within the domain of wave physics. There is a lot ahead of us, however the general mathematical principles behind what has been described in the article has been known for many years. The Fourier transform, which further allowed to mathematically describe wave superposition on a 2D screen, was first derived somewhere between 1822 and 1823. What may now strike the most is the fact, that this technology is finally available for the general public. All it takes is just a computer to run the thickness calculations, and an access to a single 3D printer. And provided that the Fourier domain of the superposition phenomena is known in the optical processors these calculations may soon become very inexpensive to perform. The only visible limitation is the storage size, however with the increasing machining tolerances for 3D printers and introducing new convolution-based error detecting algorithms it may soon become a storage of choice for those who want to portably manage their read-only data.

#### Content

The researchers at Imperial College London have made a critical breakthrough in quantum networking. They have created the foundation for quantum data transmission and called it the 'quantum internet'. Previously it was not possible to perform a long distance transmission due to data losses. The scientists have managed to successfully divide the distance into the smaller parts, while still maintaing a shared quantum state throughout the parts of the infrastructure. Astonishingly, they were able to use the existing optical fiber connections, reducing the required development to interfacing the end devices. These devices read and write the information in the form of entangled photons. A further European collaboration, aiming to improve the system's stability, storage length and minimizing the system is underway.

#### Reflection

For many years now it has been known that quantum computers, in their physical form are not going to become omnipresent in every household. They are too expensive, cumbersome and require additional infrastructure. Allowing for long distance quantum connections is therefore crucial for combining research power and providing access to quantum computing in the future. What lies ahead is a vision of each household having not a quantum computer, but rather a linking device to connect to a nearest one, professionally maintained by companies. As an aspiring cloud engineer I see this vision as a natural protrusion of what now provide typical data centers. Presenting this achievement in class has led me to believe that this novelty may indeed become widely appreciated, the moment the benefits of quantum computing outweigh the price and difficulty of its setup.

#### Content

Optimizing smartphone typing experiences for different users poses a challenge for the developers. The researchers at Aalto University have managed to create a model mimicking human typing behavoiur, effectively allowing for better testing performance. The model of a physical typer parametrizes a lot of unique factors such as: manual dexterity, visual perception and memory. With this model, the researchers have joined their efforts with Google to refine the keyboards prediction system, effectively improving our experience. 

#### Reflection

Human software quality assurance is going to be replaced by computational models. This has both its pros and cons, but for the most part will present a significant change to the way we design software. On one hand the number of tests to be performed by a machine in a given time dramatically outperforms even a large group of people. As smartphone keyboards are widely available to the general public, a model may vastly decrease the spread in how different physical testers tend to perform the tests. However, maybe that what it is all about in the first place. About how the interface must support a wide range of normal usage and edge cases. The model may easily become efficient in providing standard cases, but its lacking of the nonlinear thinking of humans may result in not covering the significant part of possibilities. In the worst scenario the model creates a lot of mediocre and repetitive tests.

Most interesting was for me the fact that the archipelago drifts to the continent with the speed of 6cm per a year. One could've though that after billions of years the situation is going to be quite different. The other interesting fact was that the islands are located at the confluence of three ocean currents, which makes them a unique place for the marine life. The last interesting fact was that the islands are located on the equator, but the climate is not tropical, because of the cold Humboldt current.
